### Footnotes

- &#9312; Silenced vs suspended: silenced means they don't appear in the Federated timeline, but if someone discovers the accounts somehow (e.g. via replying to another toot) then they can follow and it will appear in their Home view.
- &#9313; "Free speech zone": a place where it's okay to be shitty to some one/group under the guise of "free speech"
- &#9314; lolicon: sexualized depictions of children
- &#9315; Allows harassment

Notes on our instance
-----
