This is currently a bare-bones instance. I'm working to add things as I go along. As long as you're okay with some occasional down-time (so far, none) here at the beginning, you'll be good.

I'm not your parent, so act like a decent human being. To that... Everyone deserves freedom, but **not** harassment. Do the latter and you lose the former.

### Content Warnings
**CW:** On public statuses (not unlisted, private, or direct), content warnings are required for any kind of (explicit enough) violence (with or without pics, including gore, *phobia, abuse, sexual or not) and referring to it; sexual content (pics must already be tagged as NSFW, use a CW if you have text or want to warn about specific content). This is not about what is culturally or religiously accepted, but about common sources of trauma that deeply hurt people for very real reasons. Consider yourself lucky if you don't need any of it, but it's not always about you, but about others.</p>

They are also appreciated but not mandatory on: politics, spoilers, anything depressing, etc. Use them in a thoughtful, opportunistic way.

## Enforcement
	
On this instance, a status that doesn't follow these rules may be deleted. On repeated offences or if disturbing public timelines, the account may get silenced (only their followers will see statuses). If silencing is not enough, the account may get completely suspended.
	
If the account is on another instance, it may get silenced and suspended from here, and I will not hesitate to share reports with other instance admins.
	
I'll always try to solve problems in the most rational and safe way possible for users, and try to discuss any issue with the people concerned if I think it's worth it. If you at least try to be good and comprehensive, so will I. I understand and accept mistakes, but not being bad on purpose.
	
These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.
